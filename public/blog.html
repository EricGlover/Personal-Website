            <h3>CLI: a code-walkthrough</h3>
            <p>Let’s look at a few language features provided by JS to make our lives a little bit easier. To do this we’ll walkthrough some of the decisions you’d face when making a command line interface.
Imagine you’re making a node command line interface that accepts a bunch of different commands. We want it to run in the terminal with something like this </p>
            <pre>
              ‘$ node myCli someAwesomeCommand argument1 argument2’
            </pre>
            <p>So we can grab the command and arguments like so:</p>
            <pre>
              //grab the command line arguments
              let command = process.argv[2];
              let args = process.argv.slice(3);</pre>
            <p>We can imagine doing the control flow for the code that handles this input pretty easily, you could use some if’s.</p>
            <pre>
              if(command === 'entry'){
                //do some stuff
              }else if (command === 'entries'){
                //do different stuff
              }else if (command === 'tags'){
                //you get the point
              }
            </pre>
            <p>Alternatively you could use a switch</p>
            <pre>
              switch (command) {
                case "entry":
                  response = diary.entry(arguments[1], arguments[2]);
                  break;
                case "getEntry":
                  response = diary.getEntry(arguments[1]);
                  break;
                case "entries":
                  response = diary.entries();
                  break;
            </pre>
            <p>We’ve all done this sort of a thing before. It makes a lot of sense conceptually, given a certain input we want to run a certain block of code. The downside of this is it can often lead to you writing giant blocks of code within your control flow area. To remind me of this painful situation I looked at some of my old code and found one fantastic example of this had a switch statement with 5 or so cases that went on for 300+ lines. It’s unreadable. It’s unreadable because I was apparently very afraid of using functions. The file that handled the input also did a lot of other things as well. What I should’ve done is had a file to handle the input and then call some other file or module to do the work. Maybe this isn’t always necessary for small programs but at the very least I should’ve just wrapped all that code in my switch statements into separate functions. If all we’re going to do in our switch statement is call a function then there’s a cleaner way of writing this control flow. We make an object which will map our commands to their respective functions</p>
            <pre>
              let commands = {
                entry: diary.entry,
                getEntry: diary.getEntry,
                entries: diary.entries,
                entriesWithTag: diary.entriesWithTag
              };
            </pre>
            <p>Then we grab our commands and their arguments like before.</p>
            <pre>
              //grab the command line arguments
              let command = process.argv[2];
              let args = process.argv.slice(3);
            </pre>
            <p>Now we can use ‘ourMappingObject[ the key ]’ to access the appropriate function and call it all in one line.</p>
            <pre>
              //using the spread operator, fancy stuff right
              let response = commands[command](…args);
            </pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>...args?</h3>
            <p>You may of noticed the …args in that call there. This is where things get a little fun. Now that we’re doing all of our function calls in one line we may run into a problem. The problem is I’m super lazy. I already wrote the Diary class code with all the functions that we’re calling here and they aren’t expecting arrays. Here’s two of their signatures.</p>
            <pre>
              this.entry = function(message, date = Date.now()) {//stuff}
              this.entries = function() {//stuff}
            </pre>
            <p>After being faced with the prospect of going in and changing their code to deal with arrays as inputs I slipped into a well of great despair. To cheer me up I started watching some Star Trek:Next Generation and Picard said something that got me thinking; he said, ‘There can be no justice as long as laws are absolute; which is why when I want want to pass an array of values to a function that expects comma separated parameters I use the spread syntax.’ So I googled it and saw that it was good. Indeed it’s just what I needed. Thanks Picard.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Spread syntax</h3>
            <p>It’s not revolutionary stuff but it’s darn handy. Using the spread syntax you can just tell JS to unpack an array (really any iterable) in a function call. It’s useful in places other than function calls <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator'>too</a>. Here’s another way to look at it, it’s equivalent to using apply but looks better.</p>
            <pre>
              //this is the same as the below
              let response = commands[command].apply( null, args );
              //this looks so nice though
              let response = commands[command](…args);
            </pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>One last thing</h3>
            <h5>Using the rest parameter syntax for options and variable amounts of arguments.</h5>
            <p>Looking at this </p>
            <pre>
              this.entriesWithTag = function(...tags) {
            </pre>
            <p>you might wonder, ‘why on earth is that function using spread syntax?’ Well in our function declarations we can actually use the ‘…’ to undo all that hard work we just did with the spread syntax. Using this <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters'> rest parameter syntax</a> we can take any amount of parameters we pass and bundle them up into an array. This is a great way to deal with variable amounts of arguments and optional arguments. Here’s an example of using it for varying amount of arguments.</p>
            <pre>
              //here’s some
              //allow the user to search for entries by tags included in the entry
                this.entriesWithTag = function(...tags) {
                  let entriesWithTag = [];
                  //here we loop through each entry (a data structure with an array of tags included in it)
                  _entries.forEach(entry => {
                    //because …tags has packaged all our parameters into a handy array we can loop through it
                    for (var i = 0; i < tags.length; i++) {
                      if (entry.tags.includes(`${tags[i]}`)) {
                        entriesWithTag.push(entry);
                        break; //only include an entry once
                      }
                    }
                  });
                  return entriesWithTag;
                };
            </pre>

            <h2>Making the most of Git</h2>
            <h4>I solemnly swear to version control like I'm up to no good.</h4>
            <h5 id='detail'>Date : 7/23/17 </h5>

          <section>
            <p>I’ll be honest, I don’t use git. At least not in the way it seems you should. For longer than I care to remember I didn’t use it at all. Let’s take a trip back to those dark times, when it seemed like every hour or so was playing Russian Roulette with your program, it’ll be fun.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>I was writing a program to tackle the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour'>Knight’s Tour</a> problem and I wanted to start by just getting something together that would let a user attempt it themselves. I get it running, and try it out. The first time I did this I didn’t do to great and I thought, ‘I wonder if someone making completely arbitrary moves would’ve done better ( on average )?’ So I quickly comment something out here and there and add a sort of Rando-Calrissian functionality where the program runs itself making random choices for where to move. After watching Rando-Calrissian beat my score a few times I decide to extend it into a fully separate mode that the user can run. My design was terrible so I end up breaking the old mode that allowed users play it themselves. This was before I used any sort of version control so there was no going back and I spent quite some time attempting to untangle my code.
</p>
            <p>I’d like to think that things would be different now. That I would’ve committed my changes after getting it running but…</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Dealing with commitment issues</h3>
            <p>I find myself committing changes in the same fashion that I remember to save a video game- if I’m about to go do something else I save my code. Just out of habit. The problem is I don’t commit every time I get a new feature running. Committing after a new feature feels like saving your game everytime finish a quest, or beat a boss. This has lead to more debugging than I care to admit. So if I was making this program now I might’ve made a commit about half-way through implementing the first mode and another probably around the time when I had modified the already working code to make moves randomly. Now I’d at least have the option of reseting back to a previous commit instead of untangling my mess but having to reset to a point where I'm halfway through making something is .. suboptimal..</p>
            <p>After promising myself for some time now that I’d be better about committing I’ve decided that something must be done to force myself into the habit. I don’t want to spend the money to tattoo ‘What would Octocat do?’ on my hand so instead I’m turning to branches.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Branches???</h3>
            <p>But aren’t branches really only useful for working a team of developers? Mayhaps, but hopefully it'll be easier to remember to start a Rando-Calrissian mode branch than it is to remember to commit when I’ve finished a feature because branches feel like the beginning of a quest.
  An additional benefit is that small improvements that are related to working code can be done on master so if I have to scrap a branch for some reason I only lose the code for that feature.
  so if I decide that Rando is getting a little to smug for his on good and thus must be removed, I wouldn’t lose any improvements I had made to something like the way the program prints the output.
  Further, it’ll mean that I can always have a functioning version of the program laying around for demonstration. Now when someone asks what I’m working on instead of asking them to bear with me as I get my program functioning again I can just hop back onto master and run it.</p>

            <h3>One Week Later...</h3>
            <p>After a week of trying this out I've come back with some quick tips to make life easier in case you decide to start branching like crazy.</p>
            <p>Number 1. Delete your branches after you've merged them with your master branch. It's not a big deal if you don't but soon you'll see an unending list of branches and have no clue which ones you've already merged, save yourself the repetitive 'git checkout branchname' 'git status' 'git checkout master' 'git branch -d branchname' now.</p>
            <p>Next if you insist on keeping your branches entirely focused on code changes related to some feature then you'll find yourself having to switch back to master to fix something. Before you switch branches though you must do something with your current changes or when you switch they'll move with you onto master. Here I've found the stash command to be quite handy.

            <h2>Quick HTML CSS Tip</h2>
            <h4>To make the HTML nightmares go away</h4>
            <h5 id='detail'>Date : 7/16/17 </h5>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>When I first began learning HTML / CSS it was an absolute nightmare. My navbars looked like jumbled cubes, my images hovered over each other, and the thought of someone viewing the site from a screen with different dimensions....oh gahd.</p>
            <p>If you're beginning to hallucinate div repositioning themselves in your sleep, perhaps this will help ease your mind.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Close Your Eyes to EVERYTHING but divs</h3>
            <p>Yep. You probably just read a lot of tutorials about all the fabulous CSS styling properties but these will only distract you. They will confuse you to know end. So for the moment, let's just breakdown the problem a bit.</p>
            <p>Whatever it is that your making, take a good look at it and sketch out the general layout. Nav bar here. Buttons on the left, links on the right. Main content of the page there. Etc.. Now recreate this layout with divs. Make some basic classes like .red .blue .green .box and so on. If you can get your boxes to recreate this page's layout you can do anything.</p>
            <p>Make sure to start broad here, and then focus on the details - don't make divs for every button in the nav bar, just get a general navbar first then the rest of the page then add in all the details you want.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Break down making the site into components.</h3>
            <ul>The general flow
              <li>--page layout (only use colored divs) </li>
              <li>--component layout (again colored divs)    [keep track of these, put them in a scrap file or something]</li>
              <li>--make components (flesh them out)    [keep track of these, put them in a scrap file or something]</li>
              <li>--insert components into your pages</li>
              <li>--make everything else</li>
              <li>--add some style touch ups</li>
              <li>--refactor</li>
